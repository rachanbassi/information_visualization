  <!--   Data Set Information:

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details). -->

  <h1>Discussion</h1>

    <p> The data used in the above visualizations comes from the state.x77 dataset in R. The first graph is a bubble chart of the life expectancy versus income for a particular state. The size of each bubble represents the population of the state and its colour indicates the region of the state. I chose a low opacity for the bubbles to avoid losing smaller bubbles due to overlap. Lower opacity enables the user to get a clearer and complete understanding of the data. I also added functionality that allows the name of the state and its population value to be displayed when the mouse is hovered over a bubble. This allows for more data density - I have state, population, region, life expectancy and income all packed in a single bubble chart.  </p>

    <p> The second graph is a scatterplot matrix of income, illiteracy, life expectancy, and the percentage of high school graduates. The colour of the circles represents the region to which a particular state belongs. I added the brushing functionality as it provides a much nicer user experience by allowing the user to select the region of the plot or particular data points that may be of interest and how they compare across the other graphs in the scatter plot matrix. </p>

    <p> The third graph is a parallel coordinates implementation of the data. I have mapped every row in the data set for population, income, illiteracy, life expectancy, murder, percentage of high school graduations, frost (number of days with minimum temperature between freezing), total area of a state and the region to which a state belongs. I chose to implement a brushing feature which allows the users to select a particular part of a variable on one of the parallel coordinates and highlights the line connecting the data points which fall in the selected region. Further subsetting can be done by selecting different portions on other variables of the parallel coordinates. The colour of every line indicates the region to which the state belongs. I have chosen a consistent colour scheme in all three visualizations allowing for easier comparison. </p>
